    <p><span>Moon is  Earths</span> sole natural  satellite  and nearest large celestial body. It is a spherical rocky body, probably with a small metallic core, revolving around Earth in a slightly eccentric orbit at a mean distance of about 384,000 km (238,600 miles). Its equatorial radius is 1,738 km (1,080 miles). Because of the Moon’s small size and mass, its surface gravity is only about one-sixth of Earth’s.Formation of the Moon:
        According to the giant impact theory, the moon is form due to the collision of the Theia with the early earth. Theia was a rocky body. In diameter Theia has a diameter equals to half the diameter of the Earth. 4.5 billion years ago, Theia collide with the earth and this effect in ejecting a huge amount of particles into the orbit around the Earth, which later formed the Moon, and produced enough heat to form magma oceans. Now, some computer events made it possible to observe the formation of moon and shows that the moon is formed by 80% material of the Theia.</p>

                <P>The Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons.</P>

            <p class="ten text-bg-image">The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance.</p>
